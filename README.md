# 7 Wonders Duel Score Card

7 Wonders Duel is a strategy table top game for two players. 

This is a scorecard app for that game. 

I wrote it to teach myself the basics of web front-end framework Vue.

7 Wonders Duel's players go through a pre-termined number of rounds unless one of the players wins either the military or science track. They then tally their scores using the included notepad.

This app aims to be a replacement for that notepad. 

## Future features

Some added functionality that I plan to include, unless I get bored: 

* Simple checks (e.g. do the military board scores contain values other than 0, 2, 5 or 10.
* A log of previously entered scores.
* Export functions for this log.

## Development

This is based on a project template using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) generated by the [Vue Playground](https://play.vuejs.org). It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v12+.

To start:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev

# if using yarn:
yarn
yarn dev
```
